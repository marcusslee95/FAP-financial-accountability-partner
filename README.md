# FAP-financial-accountability-partner
Web app for helping you do the financial behaviors you want to do but don't find yourself doing


TOOL USED TO CREATE EACH PART OF THE APP:
React -> create-react-app
backend -> node (I just created a folder -> called it 'backend' and initialized node proect inside that folder via npm init -> used express as my way of spinning up a server and setting up endpoints -> used pg as way of interacting w/database)
database -> postgresql (just used pgadmin to create a db called 'FAP' and created tables using file that comes w/creating schema in dbdiagram.io.... and then seeded it w/some data from "seeding data.sql")
